9:T510,Brain training games (BTG) are believed to play a major role in improving cognitive functions. A recent study evaluated if BTG showed a positive impact on attention and memory functions compared with the baseline visit in healthy subjects. The study enrolled 51 normal healthy subjects to use a computerized cognitive training game (Lumosity) for exercises that target a range of cognitive functions, including attention, processing speed, visual memory, and executive functions for about 15 min per day, at least 7 days per week, for 3 weeks. The control group did not perform the training. Both groups took the CANTAB test before and 3 weeks after training for various cognitive functions (flexibility, memory, attention, speed, and problem-solving). A significant improvement in Lumosity performance index was observed in the active group compared to the control group by the end of training. After the training, a statistically significant difference in most of the CANTAB measures, such as attention-switching task (AST), mean correct latency, AST switching cost, AST mean correct latency (congruent), AST mean correct latency (incongruent), AST mean correct latency (blocks 3 and 5) [non-switching blocks], AST mean correct latency (block 7) [switching block], and MOT mean correct latency.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404:
